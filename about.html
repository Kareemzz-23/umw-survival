    <p class="content-paragraph"> UMW survival guide is a resource hub for all medical students, regardless of year of study or level.
   <br>
We aim to provide medical students with videos, presentations, notes, summaries and more. 
All resources are provided by other students who have passed their subjects, and excelled at university.
        <br>
We also offer workshops and sessions that help people develop a grasp on basic concepts and gain a blueprint to follow for that subject. 
Our resources include academic as well as extracurricular information regarding university, associations, sports, and more. How can we help ?
